# Gene Data Reformating

Open source alignment or phylogeny programs such as muscle and phylogeny.fr display accession numbers rather than organism/gene/protein names. This makes analyzed data difficult to interpret. My program reformats the info lines (denoted by > characters) so that the accession numbers and organism name are switched. The programs will then display the organism name, saving the researcher the effort of manually changing every accession number in the text file before uploading to the program. 

## Use

To use, download all programs in one directory. ReformatFasta.py is the main file, dependant on FindOrganismName.py and
changeOrganismInfo.py.Create a new, empty text file that you want to write the edited fasta file to.Write a new file, import
ReformatFasta.py, and run ReformatFasta(originalFile,newFile) with the originalFile being the directory of your gene/protein information dump in fasta format, and newFile being the empty text file. Then upload your previously empty text file to
MUSCLE or phylogeny.fr or whatever and enjoy not having to arduously edit each name by hand.

## Details

The code was all written by me in Enthought Canopy v. 1.7.4.3348. Python v2.7.11
